# Converting scikit-learn examples

Interactive examples conversion

This is an example from the scikit-learn website that I made interactive.

I did this during a sprint organized by Hugging Face in April 2023.

The original example is here (<https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_multi_task_lasso_support.html>)

When you click the binder button, the jupyter notebook will be open. It can then be run.
